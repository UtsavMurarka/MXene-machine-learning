# Machine Learning Based Classification of Non-functionalized MXenes into Metals and Non-metals 

## Introduction
This project deals with training classification models on physical properties of non-functionalized MXene molecules to classify them into metals and non-metals.
The data required was obtained from aNANt database by IISc, Bangalore.
